## Tournament of Titan Power
The spreadsheet [Titan Power.ods](https://github.com/endlessoblivion/HW/blob/89607a58b80cb6e6cf74bd3b96ef759d330c8a20/Titan%20Power.ods) helps to maximise power gain (= tournament points) per resource:
- Artifact Essence
- Titan Potion
- Titan Skin Stone
- emeralds (gems)

Note: The spreadsheet was created in Libre Office, in other apps the layout may be off.

## Strategy

During the tournament days (usually 5), only upgrade your titans by `3000` points to get the daily rewards. Do NOT collect rewards from the event's quests, leave that to the last moments before the event ends.

On the last day, 2-3 hours before the event ends, collect all the rewards from event's quests and invest all the resources needed to get to the 1st place, by a safe margin ahead of the 2nd place. The top 3 places are usually around 150 k - 200 k points, a safe margin would be +20 k points.

Usually, there's a concurrent 3-day event **`Power of the Titans`**, which will force you to upgrade titan skins (up to 40 &times;) and titan levels (up to 80 &times;) to enjoy the synergy of both events, but at the same time revealing "your cards" to the tournament opponents, because the **`Power of the Titans`** usually (but not always) ends 1 day sooner than the Tournament. On the other hand, the shop of **`Power of the Titans`** (available for 1 day after the event) may help you get additional resources on the last day of the Tournament.

During the last 3 days of the Tournament, there's usually a concurrent event **`Foundations of Power`**. Make sure to wait with spending of all relevant resources for this event, to enjoy the triple synergy:
- 50 summoning spheres
- all energy spending (bottles, mail gifts, etc.)
- all emeralds spending
- Outland chests (+3 if you open them after the event starts but before your previous guild day ends &mdash; usually there's an overlap of several hours, which you may further extend by configuring your in-game time zone)

## Resources

Your mileage may vary depending on the development state of your titans:
- on **lower levels**, upgrading titans is cheap enough, so you can aim for completing all upgrade quests:
  - 200 &times; artifacts, 80 &times; skins, 100 &times; levels
  - the shop of **`Power of the Titans`** can even have a positive feed-back loop, where you get more resources than you invested to get event points, so you can repeat it several times with a net gain
- on **higher levels**, upgrading titans gets prohibitively expensive, so you can only aim to maximise power gain, while having to ignore the "numeric" upgrade quests
  - it becomes impossible to stock up enough resources (~ 1 M each) in the time between the Tournaments (~ 1 month)
  - some "numeric" quests will give you additional resources, but in insufficient amounts, so the math usually speaks in favour of ignoring those

In general:
- titan levels are expensive and titan potions are the hardest to get in sufficient amounts (~ 600 k+)
- titan skins are relatively cheap, so even a limited amount of titan skin stones is usually sufficient (~ 300 k+)
- artifacts' levels are moderately expensive, fortunately artifact essence is usually abundant (~ 600 k+, from daily tournaments, etc.)
- artifact fragments are hard to collect &mdash; wait with upgrading artifact stars until the last day of the Tournament (never upgrade in the month in between)
- elemental seals are even harder to collect &mdash; the same as for artifact fragments applies, but don't expect seals to play a big role in the tournament

What can help to stock up resources:
- in the **Unique Offer**, there's a titan bundle that costs 12000 emeralds &mdash; buy it if you can
- assuming you have absolute stars titans, you'll get titan stones to convert them into Titan Potions in the shop:
  - in the dungeon
  - from opening the required 200 summoning spheres
- in the Guild War shop, buy Titan Skin Stones frequently (~ every day, it helps with the guild quest of 180 shop buys)

### Math

The sources of resources vary in what is the "best buy" in each of them:
- the shop of **`Power of the Titans`**: ... *TBD* ... 
- Titan resource chests: 2500 potions &times; 2000 skin stones &times; 5000 essence &times; 100 seal fragments &times; 1250 elemental tournament coins
- the Seer's chest: 30000 potions &times; 25000 skin stones &times; 16000 elemental tournament coins

However, that source &times; resource choice matters only if you aim for "numeric" quests. Otherwise, choose the resource which currently has the best power gain ratio for your titans. Most likely, in later stages, it will be the artifact essence.

E.g. 1 Titan resource chest can earn me, with my current best per-resource ratios:
- 2500 potions &rarr; at ratio 16 potions / 1 power point = 2500 / 16 = 156 power points
- 2000 skin stones &rarr; at ratio 17 skin stones / 1 power point = 2000 / 17 = 117 power points
- 5000 essence &rarr; at ratio 21 essence / 1 power point = 5000 / 21 = **238** power points

Upgrading a star of a titan artifact or a seal will not only give you immediately some extra power points, but also improves that artifact's or seal's resources-per-power efficiency, i.e. lowers that ratio. E.g.:
- upgrading an artifact at level 80 costs 3650 essence, so if it's e.g. a 2nd artifact of a light or a dark titan:
  - at 2 stars, a 1 level upgrade gives 172 power = 3650 essence / 172 power = a ratio of 21 essence / 1 power
  - upgrading that artifact to 3 stars gives **3378** power points **immediately** =~ the power difference (215 - 172) &times; 79 levels
  - at 3 stars, a 1 level upgrade gives 215 power = 3650 essence / 215 power = a ratio of 17 essence / 1 power

## Tactics

All the spreadsheet pages show ratios of resources needed per 1 power point, i.e. **the lower is better**:
- when you have free resources to spend, for each resource choose the titan (& artifact or level or skin) where the ratio is currently **the lowest**
- when you need to get additional resources, choose the resource where the total power it can earn (= resource amount / resource power ratio) is **the highest**
  - it applies equally to Titan resource chests, the Power of Titans shop, upgrades by emeralds, etc.

The progress of all titans I track in the spreadsheet by marking:
- the current level by **bold**
- the past ratios are grayed-out
- under each column I list the titans it currently applies to, regardless of a level (it changes only when there's a "star" upgrade)
- after each change in the game, the progress should be updated
- note how long the updates take you (it varies for different titan aspects), so that you know how many hours before the end of the Tournament you should start the "final push" (usually 2-3 hours)

Before the Tournament, you should align the spreadsheet with the current evolution of all of your titans. If your levels are outside of covered (calculated) regions, it should be easy to extend:
- costs per level are easy to find on-line
- power per level:
  - 1st artifacts & 3rd seals are based on known formulas, can vary +/-1 due to rounding (in spreadsheet in bold gray italics, confirmed in bold black italics)
  - 2nd artifacts have a constant power for all levels, differs only for each star evolution
  - levels & skins are based only on observations

For the "final push", prepare a last resort upgrading option (e.g. upgrading by gems 3rd artifacts of a few selected titans) in case someone else also employs the "final push" strategy and gets too close to your score. It does happen. Often.

## Titan Artifacts

Titan artifacts come in 4 groups:
- 1st artifacts of all titans:
  - variable power that depends on both the artifact level & artifact stars
  - comparable in efficiency to 3rd artifacts (seals)
- 2nd artifacts of elemental titans, i.e. crowns:
  - constant power that depends only on the artifact stars
  - the least efficient, by -5 levels compared to the 1st artifacts
- 2nd artifacts of light & dark titans, i.e. crowns:
  - constant power that depends only on the artifact stars
  - the most efficient, by +5 levels compared to the 1st artifacts
  - 2 &times; more power than 2nd artifacts of elemental titans, i.e. half the ratio
- 3rd artifacts of all titans, i.e. seals:
  - variable power that depends on both the artifact level & artifact stars
  - comparable in efficiency to 1st artifacts, but can be upgraded only by gold or gems
  - upgrading by gems is more efficient than by gold (measured by Emerald Exchange at &times; 1 on the "lucky wheel"), unless you have "too much" gold (100 M+)

E.g. at level 80 of all artifacts, with all at 4 stars, the efficiency ratios of essence cost / 1 power point are:
- 1st artifact: 18.3
- 2nd elemental: 23.0
- 2nd light / dark: 12.7
- 3rd seal: 18.3 (1 gem = 10 essence)

You can use gems also for 1st and 2nd artifacts, if you run out of essence and if the ratio is better than the gem ratio for skins or levels, but it never happened to me &mdash; I only ever used gems for 3rd artifacts (seals).

Since the upgrading of artifacts is quite time consuming:
- use it for reaching the daily `3000` power points
- use it to complete the event quest of "200 &times; artifact upgrade"
- upgrade 3rd artifacts (seals) first (the slowest), but only if you choose to invest gems / gold at all
- prepare upgrade of artifact stars for as many artifacts as you can, but don't actually do it until the "final push" window of 2-3 hours before the end of the Tournament
  - however, don't sacrifice Titan resource chests or shop coins to buy fragments, essence will be a better buy (but it's sometimes hard to evaluate)
  - use preferably daily Elemental tournament coins
  - if you find it hard to plan without actually upgrading the stars (I find it hard, it changes the ratios a lot), do it as closest to the Tournament end as possible
  
Prioritise:
- 2nd artifacts of light and dark titans
- 1st artifacts of any titans, but better of your main titan teams (usually depends on which Totems you have)
- artifacts of the 5 super-titans: Solaris, Tenebris, Hyperion, Araji, Eden

## Titan Levels

I don't have data for levels bellow 80, but for levels 80+, the upgrades are relatively expensive and get more expensive quickly:
- ratios quickly grow from 10+ potions / 1 power point at levels 80+, to 15+ at levels 90+, to 20+ at levels 100+, etc.
  - the cost ratio in gems is not good either, and is on the level of 2nd skins of most of the titans
- when buying in an event shop or opening a Titan resource chest, the choice between potions &times; skin stones depends on current levels
  - but most likely, artifact essence will be a choice superior to the other two resources
- ratios for light & dark titans are slightly better, but not by much &mdash; the difference is ~ 2 levels
  - e.g. an elemental titan at level 95 has a ratio similar to a light / dark titan at level 97, so level up light / dark ones first

## Titan Skins

Titan skins cost increases only every 5 levels, so does their resource efficiency.

There are 3 power categories of skins:
- the best: 2nd (Champion) skins of Solaris & Tenebris &mdash; ratio &lte; 6 skin stones / 1 power point, even at the highest levels
- mediocre: 2nd (Champion) skins of all other titans + new 3rd (Mechanical) skins of Angus, Sylva & Moloch &mdash; ratio ~ 15-20 skin stones / 1 power point
- the worst: 1st skins of all titans &mdash; ratio ~ 50+ skin stones / 1 power point

It's better to invest all your skin stones into 2nd skins of Solaris & Tenebris (even at cost of 20 k skin stones / level), than to level up cheap skins with bad ratio just to complete event quests &mdash; the quests' rewards never compensate the inefficiency. (If you don't have enough skin stones, you can use emeralds instead &mdash; these 2 skins have a very good ratio &lte; 1.5 gems / 1 power point.)

## Titan Totems

I may be wrong, but Titan Totems don't seem to earn enough power points to be a useful element in the Tournament winning strategy. That also might have changed with the recent introduction of totem fusions, but I don't have data neither to support that, nor to counter that.

In any case, it's a good idea to wait with a planned leveling up of a totem (e.g. of a new totem) until the time of a Tournament, preferably for the time of the "final push".

**Good luck!**
